# Fantasy Football Team Builder

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to help users look at player stats for the 2022 
season with ease to help make decisions on who they want to draft. User's can create their own teams, and 
see a list of player stats in table format. The upcoming schedule is also shown to help track NFL games. 


## Sources

[FantasyPros](https://www.fantasypros.com): Used to create a list of players for users to choose from. The CSV file from 
this website consists of players ranked 1-488 in Standard Fantasy Rankings as of August 2023.

[ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/player): Used to pull 2022 stats into a CSV file for use of looking up player stats 
and matching them up with names from the NFL rankings to be viewed. 

[GitHub](https://gist.github.com/nntrn/ee26cb2a0716de0947a0a4e9a157bc1c) Used this page on GitHub for NFL API use, and
finding the NFL schedule through ESPN hidden API endpoints. 


## What I learned

Through this project I enhanced both my front end and back end development skills, while doing something I truly love,
diving deeper into sports. This project gave me more experience with databases, third party APIs, Excel, reformatting data,
CSS, HTML, Flask, Python, Jinja, mySQL, and JavaScript. Creating something that both myself and others can use to help make decisions is something I enjoy a great deal, and seeing everything come together provided me with more problem solving experience for my future.
